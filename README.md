# Sound Separation

Sound separation code for zebra finch vocalizations.

## Extract potential calls from a file

This is a quick script that extracts calls from the first channel of a wav file. A more sophisticated extraction strategy from multichannel wav files or multiple simultaneously recorded wav files should use custom code based on this script.

From top level of the project (after installing dependencies and activating virtual environment), run

```
python scripts/process_wav_file.py <path_to_wav_file>
```

This creates a directory in the same folder as the wav file called "output" where the output numpy files will be saved.
