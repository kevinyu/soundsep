## Usage

This GUI is designed to make it easy to segment vocalizations across multiple channels from multiple experimental sources.

### Installation

#### Option 1: Installing from github

1. `git clone https://github.com/kevinyu/soundsep.git`

2. `cd soundsep`

3. `virtualenv env -p python3`

4. `source env/bin/activate`

5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Option 2.

1. Use an installer found at https://github.com/kevinyu/soundsep/releases


### Starting the GUI

1. `source env/bin/activate`

2. `fbs run`

### Loading a file

This app loads data from wav files. They should be organized into a single folder with the names "ch0.wav", "ch1.wav", etc. To load a file, go to `File > Open Directory`. Select the folder that contains the wav files and then click open (make sure you aren't accidentally selecting a subfolder).

#### Web loading

Testing out the feasibility of loading audio through web requests to a server run from the songephys project. In the songephys repo, run `python code/api/runserver.py` to start serving web requests.

Then in Soundsep, go to `File > Load URL` and enter in the full url to the session of interest:

`https://<hostname>:<port>/sessions/<session_name>`

### Setting up vocal sources

The application organizes the vocal period data by the concepts of "sources" (audio sources, which in our case are individual vocalizers) and "channels" (audio channels in the recording). For each source, the user maps it onto a channel that will be displayed for it (i.e., the microphone attached to that vocalizer, or pointing to that vocalizer). Multiple sources may be assigned to the same channel - they will display the same audio data and it is up to the user to distinguish the vocalizations from the two subjects.

To create add a source, click the orange (+) icon in the left panel. This should create a new row with a prefilled name and channel. Click the edit button to change the name of the source and the assigned channel, and click it again to confirm. The channel can be hidden with the middle button, or deleted with the trash can button.

### Data selection

An audio period can be selected by clicking and dragging on the spectrogram window.

When Amp Env view is on, you drag a threshold line across the amplitude envelope shown. When Amp Env view is off, you select a region of time-frequency space. This region is used to detect individual vocal intervals. Clicking again (not dragging) on the spectrogram will clear the current selection.

When a region is selected, you can right click for some basic options, or use the keyboard shortcuts described in the following section.

Note: If you are having a hard time getting intervals to be detected, try these:

* selecting a narrower / wider frequency range or time range in the normal view

* drawing threshold directly in the amp env view

* if there is a high noise floor, using `Z` in the normal view

* Using `Shift+W` and `Shift+S` to manually increase and decrease the amp env threshold

### Keyboard Shortcuts

![Keyboard Shortcuts](documentation/diagrams/keyboard_shortcuts.png)

The keyboard shortcuts in this are designed to have your left hand on the keyboard and your right hand on the mouse.

`A` and `D`: Move earlier and later in time

`W` and `S`: Automatically segment into calls (both do the same)

`Q`: Merge selected segments

`E`: Toggle between amplitude envelope mode on/off

`Z`: Segment into calls if you're desperate (better in broadband noise)

`X`: Delete calls in selected time range

`Shift+W`, `SHIFT+S`: Increase and decrease (respectively) the amplitude envelope threshold value used in this section

`M`: Toggle between automatic dragging mode (click and drag selection automatically triggers call segmentation when released)

`Space`: Play currently selected audio

`Esc`: Stop playing audio

### Vocalization detection

(This functionality needs improvement still)

In a long recording, it may be helpful to detect periods where there might be vocalizations first, and then focusing your attention on those periods. To do this, you can click the button that says "Detect Potential Vocal Periods" in the bottom panel. The application will freeze for a bit while it does some stuff, and then will create buttons that will jump you to relevant periods and highlight them with a green marker.

### Data export
Data is exported into a pandas DataFrame saved in a pickle file or csv. The data has columns "source_name", "source_channel", "t_start", and "t_stop" for all labeled intervals.

To export the data, go to `File > Export CSV` or `File > Export Pickle`.
